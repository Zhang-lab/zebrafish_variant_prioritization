# zebrafish_variant_prioritization

The zebrafish variant prioritization (zvp) pipeline is designed to discover, classify, and prioritize variants arising from forward genetic screens in danio rerio. The specific experimental design this pipeline was built for is described in https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012160620303079 and is for homozygous recessive variants in F3 progeny. More generally, zvp is expected to work for an incross of individuals heterozygous for the same genotypic variant, but it benefits from the epecific experimental design it was built for due to increased homozygosity around the variant of interest due to crossing-over in meiosis.
